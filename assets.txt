We did not pull any assets off the Unity asset store.
Our game is based off the Roll-a-Ball tutorial for Unity which we did earlier this semester, although most of our code has changed for this project.
All of our scripts were made by us, though they were influenced a little bit by the Roll-a-Ball tutorial.
We made:
WorldTilt
CameraController
PlayerController
l5_spinplatform
l6_platform_l
l6_platform_r
All art assets are also made by the team.
