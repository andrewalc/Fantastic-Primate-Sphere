We made all of the assets in the game with a couple exceptions:
- the font of the UI text
- the texture/material of the ball
- the skybox

Although our game was initially based off of the Roll-a-Ball tutorial, most of the code has evolved and changed to fit our needs. 
Our game is based off the Roll-a-Ball tutorial for Unity which we did earlier this semester, although most of our code has changed for this project.
All of our scripts were made by us, though some of the basic properties of picking up items and general level layout were based on the Roll-a-Ball tutorial.
We made:
WorldTilt
CameraController
PlayerController
l5_spinplatform
l6_platform_l
l6_platform_r
All blendr and art assets (with the exception of the font, ball material, and skybox) were made by Banana5.
