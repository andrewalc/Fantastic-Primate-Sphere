The most pressing question we wanted answered was: "Does this game feel like Monkey Ball," and I think the general consensus was that it didn't. 
We need to fix our scripts to make the ball accelerate/stop faster, and to make the camera more precise.

Our game worked through and through, although again, it didn't feel like Monkey Ball all to much. 
Every feature we wanted to implement for this playtest worked, and worked well.

Again, we need to fix the "feel" of the game, which is just minor camera tweaks, as well as some tweaks to physics. 
Some users said the game controls were a little unintuitive, as they wanted to use the right thumb stick to move the camera. 
Because we want this to be a good Monkey Ball recreation, we're going to try and implement Monkey Ball's camera before anything else.


We heard a lot of feedback about level ideas and we're very excited to try them out.


Again, the camera and the physics need to be tweaked.
